# Flower Exchange Trading System

## Introduction
The Flower Exchange is a trading system designed for the basic trading of flowers. It includes a Trader Application for submitting buy or sell orders and an Exchange Application for processing these orders.

## Features
- **Trader Application:** Traders can submit buy or sell orders for flowers.
- **Exchange Application:** This application processes incoming orders against existing orders in the Order Book, performing full or partial executions.
- **Execution Report:** Every order is responded to with an Execution Report by the Exchange Application, indicating the status of the order.
- **Order Validation:** Orders may be rejected due to quantity limitations, invalid flower types, etc.

## Technical Implementation
The system is implemented in C++ and includes algorithms to generate execution reports for given order files. This robust and efficient approach ensures smooth operation and accurate order processing.

## Team Members
This project was developed by two undergraduate students from the University of Moratuwa, specializing in Data Science and Machine Learning within the Computer Science & Engineering department.
